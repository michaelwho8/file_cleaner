# My File Cleaner Application
Given a list of absolute paths to directories and a day window, delete all files however old. 

Motivation: 
I use the snipping tool a lot for university coruse work. I find that the screenshots are immediately
useless after I paste them. Usually screenshots taken many days ago are useless. Hence I wanted to 
practice my Python skills by building this small app for automation.
